# Bierverkostung
This project aims to improve an abandoned [project](https://bitbucket.org/jufickel/bierverkostung).

It will consist of three parts
 - Trinkspr√ºche/Spiele
 - Bierverkostung
 - Konsum Tracking

## Hosted
This project is already hosted on https://saufen.rimikis.de. Check it out as more features will arrive.

## Versioning
For now we use a fairly uncommon versioning scheme. Until 1.0.0 we increment the minor version when work on a big new feature starts and increment accordingly until finished.
We'll switch to a more common versioning system once ready for production.
