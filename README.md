# Bierverkostung
This project aims to improve an abandoned [project](https://bitbucket.org/jufickel/bierverkostung).

It will consist of three parts
 - Trinkspr√ºche/Spiele
 - Bierverkostung
 - Konsum Tracking

## Platforms
We currently only support Android and Web. Although every package selected does also support iOS/iPadOS/MacOS i don't have a mac to text and build. Reach out to me if you want to help with this.
Regarding other Desktop support like Linux and Windows firebase currently does not support those platforms. 
We'll need to wait for this to tackle propper desktop support.

## Hosted
This project is already hosted on https://saufen.rimikis.de. Check it out as more features will arrive.

## Versioning
For now we use a fairly uncommon versioning scheme. Until 1.0.0 we increment the minor version when work on a big new feature starts and increment accordingly until finished.
We'll switch to a more common versioning system once ready for production.

```

### Local Testing
Before creating a PR be shure to test your changes!

Use emulators or real devices. Testing the web version can be done like this:
```

```
and in the output dir run
```
